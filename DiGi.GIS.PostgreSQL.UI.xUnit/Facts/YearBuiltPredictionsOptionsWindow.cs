A window whose markup failed to parse, or whose constructor threw on the county list, would not be found until someone opened it to scope a run and could not.</para>

A multi-part county is included because two of its pieces share a code and a name and are told apart only by the identifier the naming callback appends - and a run has to name every part, so both have to be selectable.</para>
        /// <para>The settings that are <b>not</b> on the window are asserted too, and they are much the larger half. The pipeline's six steps are settled by the handler rather than shown, because a tray run has one shape (ZiolkowskiJakub/DiGi.GIS.YOLO.UI#8); the weights, the confidence threshold, the year range and the radiuses all decide what the regressor is handed, and a value that disagrees with what it was trained on scores without failing (ZiolkowskiJakub/DiGi.GIS.ML#6); the working directory and the two batch sizes are not choices at all. Until OK is pressed every one of them is whatever the window was handed, which is what this asserts.</para>
        /// <para><b>It does not check what the window looks like.</b> A window is laid out by the handle it gets when it is shown, so measuring one that is never shown reports nothing, and showing one during a test run would put a dialog on screen. The controls are private to the window, so the values they end up holding cannot be read from here either - that the dialog behaves correctly on screen is still something a person has to look at once.</para>
