        /// <para>A differential assertion (Coding - Automatic Tests, section 4): the screen is the only difference. It stands behind the north wall's plane, so it can never lie between that wall and the sun, and neighbours do not reduce diffuse or ground-reflected radiation on an isotropic sky - the north wall's results must be identical. The south wall loses most of its beam. The screen is added as a shading-only element of the shading model, the kind <c>ToSolar</c> makes of every neighbour.</para>
        /// <para>Alone, the south wall is unshaded up to the solver's direction grouping: hours whose sun lies within <see cref="Constants.Default.SolarAngleTolerance"/> of each other are solved with one representative direction, so at a grazing hour the representative can fall behind the wall while the hour's own sun is just in front of it, and the box then shades its own wall. Measured, this costs the wall 0.013 of 738 kWh/m²; the bound is 0.1 kWh/m², far below the beam the screen takes.</para>
